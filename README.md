# Overview 

The goal of our research is to look at temperature data from June and December to see if having a surf store year round is feasible. We obtain the temperature data by executing two separate queries, one for June and one for December. After running our queries, we save the temperatures to a list and then transform them to a dataframe. After we've generated our dataframe, we can use the.describe() method to acquire our summary statistics. Here's what we discovered:

## Results


- June results were tropical expected weather for a surfs shop. 
- Average temperature of 75
- Minimum temperature of 64
- Maximum temperature of 85

- The findings for December were a little less tropical for surfing shop weather, but still fairly good..
- Average temperature of 71
- Minimum temperature of 56
- Maximum temperature of 83

## Summary
The average temperature in Hawaii is most definitely practical for a surf shop because it is a tropical climate year round, with temperatures ranging by less than 5 degrees. However, temperature is not the only issue to consider while selecting a shop.: 1. Examine the precipitation in the nearby locations to see if surfers are frequently rained out. 2. If strong winds are influencing surfing patterns and other factors that may cause a surfer to stop surfing.
